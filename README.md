# toggleprecisiontouchpad
script to toggle touchpad for precision touchpad laptops

**UPDATE**

there is no registry key to enable/disable precision touchpads at all. i might try and figure out how the touchpad setting app manages to do it and implement that somehow but for now the project is on hold indefinitely :(
